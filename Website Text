    <h1> About Tanner Covey </h1>
    <h3><script>document.write(new Date().toLocaleString())</script></h3>
    <div><p> Hey! If you couldn't tell from the title, my name is Tanner Covey. 
        I'm currently in a introduction course for Cybersecurity, and I've been asked to make a website about myself for an assignment.
        Please don't use any of the info you find on this website for malicious things, as this course has taught me I do not actually want 
        to have a job in Cybersecurity, won't be furthering my pursuit of the major, and therefore won't be able to do anything about malicious
        usage of my personal information! </p></div>

    <div><h2> Education </h2>
    <p> I am currently a Sophmore at Brigham Young University. You might have been able to piece it together from the introduction,
        but my major of choice is still a bit up in the air as of right now. Other than that, my main other acedemic achievement was 
        graduating from Viewmont High School in 2022.
    </p></div>
    <div><h2> Family </h2>
    <p> I come from a family of 6, and I fall second in the line-up of siblings. I have an older sister, as well as a younger sister and 
        younger brother. Originally we came from Oregon, but moved to Utah for my dad's work when I was 8 years old. My parents are almost 
        empty-nesters, as my younger sister is senior in high school as of right now, and my brother is a junior who has made it so that he 
        will graduate a year early (cause he's smart or something).
    </p></div>
    <div><h2> Religion </h2>
    <p> I am a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, along with the rest of my family. My mom joined the church with her
        mom when she was 8-years-old, and my dad joined when he was 19. I served a mission for the church from 2023 to 2025 in Morristown 
        New Jersey. I love the gospel and my Savior Jesus Christ, and am very grateful for the places that my faith has taken me.
    </p></div>
